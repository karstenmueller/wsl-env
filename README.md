Easily manage your Environment in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

## Using great tools

If you got Windows 10 on your desktop WSL is the easiest way to consume linux based free software tools.
Since this environment is more ephemeral it makes sense to manage it in a way that makes it fully disposable.

## Manage your environment

Some scripts are providing a way to save and load the environment and to install the tools you want.
